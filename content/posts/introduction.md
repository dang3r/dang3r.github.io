# Introduction

Welcome to my blog!

This site was created and powered by the following:

 1. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for static site generation
 2. [Manis](https://themes.gohugo.io/manis-hugo-theme/) for the website theme
 3. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting

Through this blog, I hope to write interesting posts about projects I am working on,
self development and life in general.
