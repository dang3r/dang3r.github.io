      <description>TL:DR pip install clickupy / https://github.com/dang3r/clickupy
Over the past few years, I have used many different project management tools. JIRA has been a consistent one, and the tool with the most name recognition. Trello is a very lightweight alternative, and the the one I personally use. Redbooth is another big player and I&amp;rsquo;ve used it heavily (especially while working there!). Wrike and Asana are a few others I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered every now and then.
It was surprising to learn about Clickup, which I have started to use at work. Largely similar to the other solutions provided, I find it strikes a nice balance between being lightweight and powerful.</description>
